## Academic honesty

Louisiana State University adopted the Commitment to Community in 1995 to set forth guidelines for student behavior both inside and outside of the classroom.  The Commitment to Community charges students to maintain high standards of academic and personal integrity.  All students are expected to read and be familiar with the LSU Code of Student Conduct and Commitment to Community, found online at www.lsu.edu/saa.  It is your responsibility as a student at LSU to know and understand the academic standards for our community. 

Students who are suspected of violating the Code of Conduct will be referred to the office of Student Advocacy & Accountability.  For undergraduate students, a first academic violation could result in a zero grade on the assignment or failing the class and disciplinary probation until graduation.  For a second academic violation, the result could be suspension from LSU.  For graduate students, suspension is the appropriate outcome for the first offense.

Further information is provided on the [LSU website](https://www.lsu.edu/online/faculty/academicintegrity.php)








## Special needs statement

My goal is to help you learn. Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their ability to perform in class can contact me privately, or reach out to the LSU Disability Services staff. 

More information on registering a disability is available at [LSU Disability Services](https://www.lsu.edu/disability/), located at 124 Johnston Hall. Contact the Center by telephone at 225-578-5919 or via email at `disability@lsu.edu`.







## Late Assignments: 

Assignments are expected to be turned in on time. I will not accept late assignments. This is motivation to commit partial work, as I will judge the work based on the last commit made before the deadline.
